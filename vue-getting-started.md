# Getting started with Vue.js

## What is Vue.js

* #### Vue.js is a front end library to build modern web/javascript applications. 
* #### Vue took all of the succesfull things from the other JS libraries and created their own framework around that. 
* #### A virtual DOM with reactive components that offer the View layer only, props and a Redux-like store similar to React.
* #### Conditional rendering, and services, similar to Angular.
* #### Cleaner, more semantic API offerings.
* #### Slightly better performance than React.
* #### No use of polyfills like Polymer.


## Installation

#### There is multiple ways to install Vue, but in this guide will focus on the Vue CLI method.
CLI stands for command line interface and the Vue CLI website has all the necessary docs on the finer details of the tool and we will not cover that here. 

#### Step 1
Open up a terminal and on the command line and paste the following command. 

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
_(Please note that you have to have npm installed, which we will also not cover in this guide.)_

#### Step 2

Let's create our very own Vue app by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vue create insert-app-name-here
```
The Vue CLI will start the process of installing your app by creating a folder in the root folder that ran the command from with all the necessary files. You will be prompted with a default or manual installation option. Once again refer to the official Vue CLI docs to determine what you need. 

#### Step 3

Open the above folder in your favourite code editor.
